```bash
# Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

# Using Cargo
cargo install killport

# Using install script
curl -sL https://bit.ly/killport | sh

# From source (this repository)

sudo cp target/release/killport /usr/local/bin/
```

## Installation

### Method 1: Quick Install Script

```bash
cd gnome-extension
./install.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Copy the extension to your GNOME extensions directory:

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not appearing
- Ensure GNOME Shell is restarted after installation
- Check if the extension is enabled: `gnome-extensions list --enabled`
- View logs: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell`

### "killport command not found"
- Ensure killport is installed and in your PATH
- Test with: `which killport`
- If installed locally, add to PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/killport`

### Permission errors
- Some ports may require elevated privileges to kill
- The extension will show an error notification if it can't kill a process
- Consider running processes with appropriate permissions

## Development

### File Structure
```
killport@rohansx.github.com/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.js      # Main extension logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json     # Extension metadata
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stylesheet.css    # UI styling
```

### Testing Changes
1. Make your changes to the extension files
2. Restart GNOME Shell to reload
3. Check logs: `journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep -i killport`

### Debugging
Enable debug output by modifying extension.js:
```javascript
const DEBUG = true;
function debug(msg) {
    if (DEBUG) log(`[KillPort] ${msg}`);
}
```
